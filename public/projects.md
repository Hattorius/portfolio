### [2022-07-05] Jackpot contract - frontend <i class="devicon-nodejs-plain"></i> <i class="devicon-svelte-plain"></i> <span class="iconify" data-icon="simple-icons:web3dotjs"></span>

Simple user interface to interact with the Jackpot contract. Shows the Jackpot amount and previous bets. And lets users bet on the Jackpot.

### [2022-07-04] Jackpot contract - backend <i class="devicon-python-plain"></i> <span class="iconify" data-icon="simple-icons:web3dotjs"></span>

A script written in Python that keeps track of the events on the Jackpot contract. When a new bet is done and confirmed, the script will generate a new number using [Random.org](https://www.random.org/) and create an automatic transaction to the contract to push the random number, with the ticket given by [Random.org](https://www.random.org) so users can validate the random number.

### [2022-07-04] Jackpot contract <i class="devicon-solidity-plain"></i>

This contract lets users bet on a price pool. The users can choose how much to bet by theirselves, but the more you bet the more chance you have to win the Jackpot. The maximum bet amount is 1% of the Jackpot, which gives you a winchance of 0.5%. When an user wins they'll be paid out 80% of the Jackpot automatically. There is also a referral system that pays the referer 10% of all the bets an user makes. 50% of every bet goes into the Jackpot to make the Jackpot grow more over time. Random numbers are generated by [Random.org](https://www.random.org/).

### [2022-06-28] Coinflip casino - frontend <i class="devicon-nodejs-plain"></i> <i class="devicon-svelte-plain"></i>

This isn't finished and I'm not planning to finish this. This is the user interface of the "Coinflip casino contract". It lets users interact with the contract through a simple website. A lot of stuff is already implemented,
but I don't want to finish this.

This project isn't finished.

### [2022-06-27] Coinflip casino contract <i class="devicon-solidity-plain"></i>

### [2022-04-11] Cloudflare Bot Management Solver <i class="devicon-nodejs-plain"></i>

By reverse engineering the Cloudflare Bot Management program injected into websites that use it, I've been able to produce solutions that Cloudflare Bot Management accepts (and prevents you from getting flagged as a bot while scraping)

### [2022-04-05] AnimeNext - backend <i class="devicon-typescript-plain"></i> <i class="devicon-mongodb-plain"></i> <i class="devicon-express-original"></i>

By using the anime scraper (mantioned below "Anime scraper"), this is the backend of the website "AnimeNext".
The backend of AnimeNext (to match users to other users in the database) is a lot of load. I've spent a lot of time making this program is efficient as possible. The algorithm I wrote is as efficient as I can possibly imagine,
and it now finds the best recommendations for users by looking through a database with ~19.000 anime's, 35.000+ users and ~30.000 relations in ~195ms.

This project is not intended to be published: View "AnimeNext - frontend" for a live preview.

### [2022-04-05] Anime scraper <i class="devicon-typescript-plain"></i> <i class="devicon-mongodb-plain"></i> 

By scraping users on the [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) anime fan site, the program gets the list of anime's watched by all the users, and saves this in a mongodb.

### [2022-03-23] Tap! <i class="devicon-nodejs-plain"></i> <i class="devicon-react-original"></i> <span class="iconify" data-icon="simple-icons:expo"></span> <span class="iconify" data-icon="file-icons:styledcomponents"></span>

Was really bored, made an app using React Native. It's a simple app with no functionality at all. You tap on a button and it counts the amount of times you tapped on it.

Because this project is really simple and small I won't specify the source nor publish it on GitHub.

### [2022-01-19] Slaphands - website <i class="devicon-html5-plain"></i> <i class="devicon-css3-plain"></i> <i class="devicon-javascript-plain"></i> <span class="iconify" data-icon="simple-icons:web3dotjs"></span>

### [2022-01-18] Solidity highfive contract <span class="iconify" data-icon="simple-icons:solidity"></span>

Fun and simple Solidity contract! It let's people highfive eachother on the blockchain, and rewards the highfive receiver with a "HIGHFIVE" token. I don't know, just felt like doing this.

### [2021-12-27] Discord account generator <i class="devicon-python-plain"></i>

This is a bit less on the white side of the internet. This program creates a Discord account and verifies it's email and phone number within 90 seconds. It's fully automized and solves captcha's to do so. These accounts then can be used to mass advertise by direct messaging users. (I'm sorry)
