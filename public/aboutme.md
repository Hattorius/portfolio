# About me

<img style="float: left; width: 8rem; margin-left: 0;" src="https://i.imgur.com/f9gLhjB.png">Hi,  I'm Aaron. A 19 year old developer from the Netherlands. I got over 7 years of experience developing the web with 4 years experience in freelance development

*(Currently being bored at university)*

### Where it all started

It all started when I was 7. My parents took me to an open day at the University of Amsterdam. There I got introduced to coding for the first time with [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mid.edu). Since then I've been having fun with that website creating little games and programs. Eventually I found websites that I wanted to recreate, just to see if I could do it. And that stimulated me to work even more on my skills.

### High school

My high school experience wasn’t the greatest. I wanted to be busy with coding while my parents wanted me to work on school. I wasn’t interested in any of the subjects they gave on the school and I had a hard time getting good grades. As soon as I could get out of high school, I did so: not getting my diploma. This was, after all, the best decision I’ve ever made.

### College

After dropping out of high school without any diploma, I got the offer to go to college. I took the offer as I expected the classes to be more focused on what I chose, instead of general subjects. Because of this I **finished college in 2 years** instead of 4 years. Now I finally had a piece of paper defining that I know some stuff about coding. *(While not even doing anything on college)*

### University

I'm currently attending the University of Applied Sciences Windesheim. They got some cool stuff, but I don't feel challenged at all after going to university for 2 months now. Until now there has been nothing that was actually new to me.

## I ❤️ code

As you've read in the text above, I've been coding all my life and I don't think that'll change. I love the way that coding works: solving a big puzzle by dividing it into smaller puzzles and solving them one by one. I've come to believe that nothing is impossible to do in software.
